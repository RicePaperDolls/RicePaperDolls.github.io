        <h1>Let's gather some magic!</h1>
        <strong></strong>
        <p>Recently I've gotten back into Magic the Gathering. 
            I picked up the hobby years ago but found that I had no one to really play with so I 
            ended up taking a break from it. If you've never heard of the game, 
            here's the link to the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en">offical website</a>.</p> 
      <p>When it comes to building the decks I play with, 
        I've been really liking using <a href="https://archidekt.com/">Archidekt</a>. 
        The tool is really well fleshed out and user friendly, plus they have a mobile app so you 
        can make decks while out and about (or while you wait in line like I do sometimes). </p>

      <p>Here are some of the commanders for my current rotation of decks~ </p>
